    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This parent.html loads iframe.html and emulates the Source application,
      responding to the initial 'hello' message, and passing context and tokens
      to the iframe.</p>

    <p>The iframe.html file, when loaded as an iframe by parent.html, demonstrates how
    a frame plugin works within the Source web application.  The plugin
    javascript does the following:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Subscribe to context updates from the parent window, which will
          trigger us to call a demo backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call <code>SourceBridge.init()</code> to kick off the required
          handshake with the parent window.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we have received context, we call into a demo backend and display
          the response in the div above.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The demo backend (in this same codebase) has two functions:
      <ol>
        <li>Dispense a Source application token to the parent window.</li>
        <li>
          Handle a request from the iframe with the application token, verify
          the token, and echo the claims of the token.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
